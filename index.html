    <h1>The best Gluten-Free Sandwich Bread Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Gluten Free</h2>
    <h2>Dairy Free</h2>
    <p><Why this is special: most GF bread is either hard or overly crumbly,
 this has a real bread feel and taste and freezes especially well!</p>
<p>Originally this recpie came from Kirari west bake shop in Redondo beach.
They sold a gluten free flour.  They discontinued the flour and told me it 
was actually Steve's GF Bread Flour from authentic foods.   
You'll need a stand mixer for this or really persistent mixing effort.  
Also works best with a 9 x5 glass loaf pan.</p>
<p>The Recipe from Steve's is different from the Kirari one and the Kirari 
one is what we've made so here it is:</p>
<p>This is dairy free: </p>
<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Steve's Bread Flour - 430 grams</li>
    <li>Warm Oat Milk - 1 1/4 cup</li>
    <li>Olive Oil - 70 grams</li>
    <li>Sugar - 25 grams</li>
    <li>Egg - 1 whole egg</li>
    <li>Egg White - 1/2 cup</li>
    <li>Instant dry yeast - 2 teaspoons</li>
    <li>Warm Water - 1/4 cup</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparing the Dough:</b></p>
<p>Start with a bowl and add sugar, warm water, and yeast and let the 
yeast proof for about 5 minutes.  Warm the oat milk to about 115 degrees 
in the microwave.  Put the flour in the stand mixer with a normal 
paddle (not the dough hook or the wire) and start it on very low add the 
warm oat milk, the eggs and egg whites, the olive oil and finally the 
proofed yeast mixture.  Mix for 10 minutes at medium speed. </p>
<p><Next grease the loaf pan with olive oil (or whatever).  
Add the dough to the loaf pan and spread it out.  
Cover the dough with oiled saran wrap and proof in a warm over 
(like 95 degrees) for 50-70 minutes.  The dough should rise to about 
and inch above the pan (or a little over).</p>
<p><b>Baking the Bread:</b></p>
<p>Bake in a preheated over at 375 degrees (350 convection) for 
approximately 60-70 minutes.  When the bread is finished baking, 
remove from the pan and let cook for 1 hour before cutting.</p>
<p>We found a cool bread slicer on amazon for homemade bread.</p>
<p>To make it dairy use milk and butter.</p>
